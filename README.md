# Colored Icon Kit

This is a Geometry Dash Geode mod to all icons (icon kit, shops, achievements, etc.) to use your <cg>player colors</c> instead of the default gray. Locked icons also show more detail.

Mod idea heavily based on [Colored Icon Kit](https://github.com/sofabeddd/Colored-Icon-Kit) by sofabeddd.
